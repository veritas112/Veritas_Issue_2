With more than 250 participants,                         the workshop was to enlighten participants about the structure of teeth, to estimate                          the age of a given set of teeth, and also to write a report on the same along with rugae                          analysis and lip print analysis.                         Prof. Don Caeiro, Co-ordinator, Unit of Forensic Science, gave a prelude to the work-                          shop where he explained what the workshop entailed, and that the workshop would                          have 6 sessions with a wide variety of topics.                                           INAUGURAL SESSION:                                      The workshop was inaugurated by Dr. Muhammad Nasir Ahmed, a renowned foren-                          sic anthropologist with more than 10 years of experience in the practical aspect of                         anthropology. The presidential address during the inauguration was delivered by Fr.                          Augustine George, Principal, Kristu Jayanti College. The Chief Guest, Dr. Muhammad                          Nasir Ahmed, proceeded to explain by using a presentation, how the fields of Forensic                         Anthropology and Forensic Odontology were allied and why we need more experts in                          the same. He introduced to the participants the concept of using Forensic Science in                         humanitarian action using the knowledge and skills obtained from anthropology and                          odontology. He also enlightened the participants about why we need Forensic Anthro-                          pology and its importance in the court of law. He stated that “Forensic anthropologists                         focus on the origin, in terms of evolution and the origin of the specimen given to them.”                          He emphasized what forensic anthropologists do and the questions they try to answer                          when they find evidence. He further described the scope of Forensic Anthropology in                         India, and for students who were planning on making a career out of it, he explained                          ways in which to plan their career.","FIRST PART OF THE ODONTOLOGY WORKSHOP                                                                                                                                                                                 Date: 9th October, 2021                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SESSION 1: DENTITION AND DENTAL ANOMALIES - POINTS OF                         IDENTIFICATION OF A TOOTH                                      The first session was handled by Dr. Shrivya Saloni Mahaveeran. Dr. Shrivya began the                          session with a basic overview of ‘Human Dentition and Its Forensic Significance’ and                         emphasized how Forensic Odontology can help solve legal cases by providing valuable                          scientific backing. She spoke about how a detailed examination of dental evidence can                          be used for identification purposes as well. Dr. Shrivya further stated that dental iden-                         tification is based on the principle of ‘No two oral cavities are alike’ and the structural                          and morphological features of teeth make them unique for each individual. She then                         went on to explain the sequence of eruption in both primary teeth and permanent                          teeth, and touched upon the points of identification, focusing on the maxillary cen-                          tral incisor, maxillary canine, and mandibular first molar. Towards the end, she briefed                         the participants about the common tooth anomalies seen and the specific features of                          each. She talked about how such anomalies can be used as unique identifying dental                          features.","SESSION 2: IDENTITIFICATION OF DENTITION AND ARCHES and                         Radiographs (IOPA \& OPG)                                       The second session of the workshop was conducted by Dr. Shrivya Saloni Mahaveer-                         an who continued with the workshop. She enlightened the students on the different                          types of dental arches and dentitions and practically demonstrated how to identify                          them. The workshop on dental identification was divided into two parts – Firstly the                         delegates were taught how to identify the arches and dentitions using casts. The stu-                          dents were actively engaged in exercises where they had to identify the dental arches                         and dentitions shown to us in the presentation and note them down. Secondly, the                          resource person showed the participants the dental identification using two types of                          radiographs – OPG (Orthopantomogram) and IOPA (Intraoral Periapical) radiograph                         along with the exercises on the identification of the same. Towards the end, Dr. Shrivya                          summarized the session by emphasizing the importance of radiography in Forensic                          Odontology concerning identification.

During this session, Dr. Akhil provided the delegates with a de-                         tailed explanation on how to estimate the age of a person using casts and radiographs.                          He further taught how to identify dental anomalies using casts and radiographs and                          along with the orientation of OPG (Orthopantomogram). The explanation was given                         along with real-life examples, performed as tasks for the participants of the workshop                          to give us a better insight into the application of the principles of odontology in au-                          thentic crime scenarios and their study.                         The tasks conducted answered questions like the ones mentioned below:                          a) Was the individual a minor or a major?                          b) Is he/she above 18 years of age or below?                         c) Is it a maxillary or mandibular cast?                          d) Are there any dental anomalies? If yes, what are the anomalies? Etc.                         Dr. Akhil also introduced the format of the reports of forensic odontologists. He also                          provided an assignment for the delegates to write a report in a case which he provided                          them.","PART TWO OF THE ODONTOLOGY WORKSHOP                                                                                                                                                                              Date: 23rd October, 2021                                                                                                                                                                                                                SESSION 4: RUGAE PATTERN - BRIEF INTRODUCTION ON TYPES OF                         RUGAE                                      The second part of the workshop on Forensic Odontology was held on 23rd October                          2021. The resource person for the first session of this part was Dr. Akhil.S. Shetty, an                          oral pathologist and forensic odontologist started the session by defining the word                         “rugae pattern”, followed by its history. Students were intrigued to know that it dated                          long back to 1932. He had demonstrated the picture of the rugae pattern making it eas-                          ily understandable for the students. In his explanation, he also mentioned what they                         are called otherwise along with their benefits or their role in the human body.                                     The resource person, thereafter, stated that the process of collecting the rugae pattern                          from an individual was divided into 3-4 steps. “These rugae pattern impressions that                          are collected are then analysed with the help of divider, cast, pencil and scale measure-                         ment”, stated Dr. Akhil. The resource person also explained the different classifications                          of these patterns with the help of images of the same. Before ending the session, he in-                         cluded an example of how the rugae patterns helped solve a case of a five-year-old.","SESSION 5: RUGAE PATTERN ANALYSIS AND REPORT WRITING                           The fifth scientific session of the two-part online workshop on Forensic Odontology                         was a demonstration session on analyzing rugae patterns and report writing in cases                          involving rugae patterns. The resource person for the session was Dr. Akhil S.Shetty,                          Oral Pathologist and Forensic Odontologist.                         Following the briefing on palatal rugae and the methods to record and trace the rugae                          patterns in the previous session, Dr. Akhil explained the types of palatal rugae found                         in the maxillary arch based on their shape, unification, and direction. He discussed the                          occurrence of specific types of rugae patterns depending on the topography and sexes                          of individuals. The use of detailed images and practice questions helped the partici-                         pants comprehend the concept.                          The next part of the session focused on the aspect of report writing after analyzing the                          rugae patterns.                         Dr. Akhil guided the participants on how to prepare reports following the analysis of                          rugae patterns. He elaborated on the importance of preparing an organized report to                          explain the findings after the analysis.                         The participants were also provided with practice questions to polish their skills in                          preparing such reports.

Nair                                                         We are extremely honoured to have had the opportunity to interview                                      Mr. Zackery Kowalske, who is currently employed as a Detective with                                        the Roswell Police Department’s Crime Scene Investigations Unit. Mr.                                      Kowalske has a Master’s degree in science with a Forensic Science con-                                        centration. His study is based on bloodstain pattern analysis, and he is                                      currently pursuing a Doctorate in forensic science. His areas of expertise                                        are bloodstain pattern analysis and shooting incident reconstruction.","Mr. Kowalske has also been a guest lecturer in the international we-                                                   binar on “Future of Crime Scene Investigations”, conducted by the                                                   Unit of Forensic Science in Kristu Jayanti College, Autonomous. This                                                   interaction helped us gain more insight into the discipline of blood-                                                   stain pattern analysis and crime scene reconstruction.                                                              1. What was the first-ever case you’ve handled?                                                              I started as a jail officer when I was twenty years old and was really                                                   interested in the field of forensics even at that time. So my first case                                                   would probably be an investigation of the suicide of a jail inmate.                                                              2. What is the hardest blood spatter pattern you’ve analyzed? What                                                   is the hardest blood pattern to analyze in general?                                                              The hardest spatter pattern I’ve worked on was a secondary splash                                                   pattern found on the sole of the victim’s feet, who had been executed,                                                   and her body had been positioned. I worked on it for a month, going                                                   through various body positions consistent with the different factors                                                   and components of the scene. The hardest spatter patterns to analyze                                                   are nondescript patterns where there aren’t enough characteristics                                                   to classify them.                                                              3. What are the routine steps followed during crime scene recon-                                                   struction?                                                              The basic steps would be:                                                   • Documentation (photography, videography, or laser scanning)                                                   • Collecting samples                                                   • Analysis/synthesis of data                                                              4. How do you keep your mental health in check?                                                              This topic is very close to me because, being a sworn detective, we come                                                   across a lot of cases such as child homicides and violent deaths, and                                                   I’ve personally been involved in a shooting as well. So there is a lot of                                                   trauma involved. If you don’t know how to process the way it impacts","you, then it can lead to a self-destructive path. I had been there, and                                                   eventually, I could comprehend how it had been affecting me so I could                                                   move forward, but that is not everyone. There has been an exponen-                                                   tial rise in the rate of suicide of law enforcement personnel, so I be-                                                   lieve it’s important to introduce mental health awareness in training                                                   and universities to prepare new investigators.                                                              5. Has there been any case where the modus operandi was some-                                                   thing you had never seen before?                                                              A double homicide of two teenagers I worked on a few years ago was                                                   brutal. There were acts that took place, which I could tell based on                                                   the blood patterns on the victims, which was something I had never                                                   encountered before.                                                              6. What is the evidential importance of blood pattern in a case?                                                              In most reconstructions of shootings, needing to know how exactly                                                   the shooting happened helps to understand if it was self-defence or                                                   not. And therefore, from a forensic standpoint, to provide information                                                   through blood pattern analysis to either refute or include a suspect’s                                                   testimony is important. In cases where finding the area of origin is                                                   crucial, it can be shown irrefutably with physics and math how the                                                   conclusion was arrived upon.                                                              7. Have there been any changes in the modus operandi of crimes                                                   during the pandemic?                                                              One of the most difficult aspects, as a general law enforcement officer,                                                   is the fact that everyone wears a mask. It makes it difficult to identi-                                                   fy people in video surveillance. So that is the biggest impact from an                                                   investigator’s point of view.                                                              8. How do you manage your work-life balance?                                                              It is constantly hectic. I am currently working on my PhD as well. So,                                                   it feels like I’m juggling three chainsaws on fire. It helps me when I","add all my tasks and schedules in Outlook so that I can have a clear                                                    view of what my day consists of. I also constantly send myself emails                                                    when I think of ideas or get reminded of tasks to do so they can jog                                                    my memory when I get to the office the next day.                                                               9. What are the recent developments in crime scene reconstruc-                                                    tion?                                                               Crime scene reconstruction has come a long way. If I had to pick one                                                    development that we should focus on and would’ve had the largest                                                    impact on the discipline is the implementation of Artificial Intelli-                                                    gence.

Myth - If a computer is found off at a crime scene,                             it should be switched on to analyze.                                        Fact - Digital evidence should always be left in                             the condition that they are found in, and if found                            in ON, RAM should be collected, and the power                             supply should be unplugged.","INTERACTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      WITH MRS.

How well is Forensic Psychology understood in India?                                                                For that, you’ll have to divide the country into two parts - the north-                                                     ern part and the southern. In the northern part, Forensic Psychology                                                     is quite established, and we have a lot of case inflow as well. Even the                                                     results that the Forensic Science Laboratories (FSLs) give are reliable.                                                     Coming to the southern part of the country, we don’t have that many                                                     FSLs equipped with Forensic Psychology. Bangalore, Kerala, and Chen-                                                     nai have also only recently started, so not much case inflow is there.                                                     Even the police don’t have much idea about Forensic Psychology. Psy-                                                     chological evidence is only corroborative, and the court accepts this                                                     only as secondary evidence.                                                                2. Are mental illness examinations of criminals conducted in FSLs?                                                                We don’t deal with that part where we see whether the person is men-                                                     tally sane or not. Whatever cases we have gotten so far, it has only","been normal individuals who have been committing crimes. We ha-                                                    ven’t gotten cases where the person has an extreme disorder like an                                                    antisocial personality disorder or other personality disorders. That is                                                    usually dealt with by NIMHANS (National Institute of Mental Health                                                    and Neurosciences) . If the court wants to see if a person is compe-                                                    tent enough to stand trial then it is sent to NIMHANS and they do                                                    the competency test. What we do is only related to polygraph, brain                                                    mapping, and narco analysis. The other section is usually done by                                                    clinical psychologists.                                                               3. What type of crimes are referenced to you the most?                                                               We get different varieties of cases such as murder, theft, smuggling,                                                    and rape. Murder cases constitute 80-90% of the cases we get. We                                                    did have a theft case that involved a long list of suspects, which was                                                    quite time-consuming. Mostly it is 302 IPC (Indian Penal Code) and                                                    POCSO (Protection of Children against Sexual Offences) cases.                                                               4. What is done when a person going on trial is suspected to be                                                    mentally ill?                                                               If the court sees that the person is not mentally sane, then they go                                                    for a psychiatric evaluation, and as per the result, they give the rul-                                                    ing. Maybe they admit them into a psychiatric ward where they will                                                    be monitored often.                                                               5. Is criminal profiling often used in India? Under what circum-                                                    stances is it used?                                                               Criminal profiling is rarely used. As far as I know, it was used in the                                                    Burari deaths case. The Delhi FSL and CBI (Central Bureau of Inves-                                                    tigation) did the criminal profiling, and they were able to identify the                                                    cause. Similarly, a 20 - 25-year-old case in Kerala also used criminal                                                    profiling where they were able to assess how the death happened.                                                    Criminal profiling is like the autopsy of the psychological state of                                                    the person, which has led to death. Western countries do give a lot of                                                    importance to Forensic Psychology as they emphasize on men","tal wellbeing, so criminal profiling is frequently practiced. However,                                                    criminal profiling needs are yet to be discovered in India. The FSLs                                                    are not into profiling since it requires experts who have 10-15 years of                                                    experience.                                                               6. What was the first case that you worked on?                                                               It was a murder case, and it was quite confusing. All the teams worked                                                    on the case and talked with the suspect. And we did arrive at some                                                    interesting conclusions. It was a 302 case of murder and burning.                                                               7. What are the psychological assessments most commonly prac-                                                    ticed in India?                                                               We do an extensive MSE (Mental Status Examination) on the suspect                                                    and a pre-test and post-test interview. In other FSLs, even personali-                                                    ty tests like the Draw-a-man test, 16PF (The Sixteen Personality Fac-                                                    tor Questionnaire) , and TAT (Thematic Apperception Test) are done.                                                    Every FSL has its own way of investigation and mode of procedure.                                                    Mostly it is personality tests; MSE and clinical interview methods,                                                    which are done before any other procedures like brain mapping, nar-                                                    co analysis, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Myth - Test firing for a control bullet is done                                                                                                                                                                                                                        outdoors.

Which type of crimes do you encounter the most? And what dif-                                                    ficulties do you face when conducting an autopsy for those cases?

Though a case of hanging could be easy to handle, it is an                                                    extremely common case for masking certain important findings. Keen                                                    observation is the key to handling any case. Sometimes, the absence                                                    of ligature marks, the uncommon position and the placement of the                                                    knots in such cases can complicate comprehending or ascertaining                                                    the cause of death. Also, for cases of hanging, specific bloodless flap                                                    dissection of the neck needs to be followed. This might require more                                                    training and expertise than normal.                                                              2. Would you summarize the general procedure of an autopsy, while                                                    emphasising the most important organs or serological samples                                                    that you retrieve or examine first?                                                               The procedure for an autopsy starts with a proper requisition from                                                    the concerned officials on par with guidelines of Sec. 174 CrPC (The                                                    Code of Criminal Procedure) for Police inquest or Sec. 176 CrPC for                                                    Magistrate inquest. After due paperwork, we try to elicit a required                                                    history from the investigating officers and in dicey situations and                                                    demand inspection of the crime scene, we request the officers and                                                    take a visit. Following these, we request the investigating officers to                                                    confirm the identity of the individual and then start with an exter-                                                    nal examination. External examination includes analysing the basic                                                    morphology, build, clothing, appearance. We take note of identifica-                                                    tion marks to establish the identity of individuals for documentation                                                    as this especially comes in handy in cases of unknown or unclaimed                                                    bodies. After identification, we appreciate the changes of death that                                                    can be seen in the deceased like algor mortis, rigor mortis, or livor                                                    mortis. These changes help us ascertain the time since death in cer-                                                    tain situations. External examination also takes into account the de-                                                    scriptions of external injuries which could help determine manner of                                                    death, direction and cause of injuries. We also actively search for","clues or hints that could indicate signs of struggles before death. An                                                    internal examination follows the external examination. The com-                                                    monly employed technique for autopsy is Virchow’s technique. De-                                                    pending on the initial case history we prioritise individual organ sys-                                                    tems and go in an orderly fashion and appreciate changes seen in                                                    individual organs. For specific cases, specific modifications are made                                                    to this process. Lastly, we preserve organs/samples for histopatholog-                                                    ical examinations and toxicological analysis. The selection of organs                                                    and the choice of preservatives keep changing on a case-to-case ba-                                                    sis. But, the most common organs preserved for toxicological anal-                                                    ysis include, a portion of liver, portions from both the kidneys, 10ml                                                    of blood, stomach and part of the intestine along with their respec-                                                    tive contents, and urine. When it comes to histopathological analysis,                                                    commonly preserved organs include the heart, lungs, and liver. Con-                                                    sidering the Union territory of Puducherry, where I practice is a hub                                                    for alcoholics, pancreas is also sent for histopathological evaluation.                                                    We also ensure to write appropriate duly signed labels for these sam-                                                    ples, pack them and send them to the concerned labs. After the entire                                                    procedure is over, care is taken to pack the deceased body and give it                                                    a proper aesthetic appearance for the relatives/attenders to perform                                                    the appropriate send-off rituals.                                                               3. What conditions, concerning the body, make it hard to conclude                                                    an autopsy?                                                               The physical form in which a body is retrieved from the site of crime                                                    makes a huge impact on a successful autopsy. This physical form of                                                    the body in turn narrows down to the time at which autopsy is per-                                                    formed and the difference between the actual time of death.

Would you throw light on your experience with your first autop-                                                    sy? How challenging was it mentally?                                                               I believe, for everything, there is a first time, and irrespective of how                                                    the experience is, it always stays etched in our hearts in indelible ink.                                                    The very first case I was assigned was a brought dead case of a mid-                                                    dle-aged man to the casualty. After all the paperwork was done, the                                                    body was positioned on the post-mortem examination table. There                                                    were mixed feelings within me. Some part of me was happy and ex-                                                    cited to investigate the first-ever case assigned to me, while some part                                                    of me was proud of myself for landing at that position where I could                                                    contribute to serving justice to people and solving the unexplained.                                                    Equally, there was apprehension popping up, as both the responsibil-                                                    ity associated with conducting a post-mortem examination and the                                                    heat of justice is heavy to handle. Let’s never forget the anxiety that                                                    tags along with any of our first steps. As soon as I saw the deceased,                                                    I had to exert that handle of control on all my thoughts and focused                                                    on only doing my best in the best possible way. External examination                                                    revealed nothing remarkable. In such cases, considering the age of                                                    the deceased, the second-best shot was to examine the cardiovascu-                                                    lar system. As I began exploring the thoracic cavity, I noticed the peri-                                                    cardial sac enlarged and the sac congested. Further, it was evident                                                    that the likely cause of death was cardiac tamponade. On dissection                                                    of the heart, it became clear that there was ventricular rupture lead-                                                    ing to cardiac tamponade. This one experience strengthened the idea                                                    in me that a proper autopsy can solve unsolved mysteries. It was an                                                    important component for serving justice to the deceased or his/her                                                    family. It boosted my morale and added confidence in me. Handling                                                    dead bodies of deceased individuals, the endless heinous crimes and                                                    the humanity that is tossed in such situations was never mentally                                                    taxing to me. Probably one possible reason to not be affected mental-                                                    ly is that I came determined and was expecting these when I chose                                                    Forensic medicine as my speciality.                                                               5. How long did it take for you to get used to the process, and did                                                   you take any measures to help you adapt it?","I feel I was pre-prepared for facing this. The adaptation phase for me                                                   did not take much longer. I knew I was going to be doing this when                                                    I chose my speciality. One reason for my easy adaptation was that I                                                    was bestowed with a conducive environment filled with an under-                                                    standing family, great peers and thick friends. Apart from this, keep-                                                    ing your mental balance on frequent checks is the key to adapting                                                    faster. “Always expect the unexpected” has been the motto that keeps                                                    me going!                                                                                                                                     Myth - Deleting files from the recycle bin will                                                   permanently delete a file.                                                              Fact - Deleting from the recycle bin will only                                                   delete the file entry, but the contents will still                                                   be there. Hence, deleted files can be restored                                                  while doing digital forensic analysis.","GLOBAL NEWS UPDATES                                                                       RELATED TO FORENSIC                                                                                                                                                                                                  SCIENCE                                                                                                 •  DNA PHENOTYPING                                                                            •  TECHNIQUE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF                                                                                HIGH-RESOLUTION FINGERPRINT IMAGES                                                                                FROM CURVED SURFACES                                                                            •  FORENSIC JOURNALISM – AN UPCOMING                                                                                FIELD OF FORENSIC SCIENCE                                                                            •  THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE PLAYED BY                                                                                NANOPARTICLES IN DEVELOPMENT OF                                                                                FINGERPRINTS                                                                            •  THE JOURNEY FROM CRIME TO JUDGEMENT","DNA PHENOTYPING                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Ms. Vyshnavi                                                                Many discoveries and inventions have led to the advancement of                                         science and technology. Forensic was introduced during the 1830s and                                           has gotten bigger now. Many new technologies of forensic science have                                         been launched that have helped the crime scene investigations to go                                           smoothly by identifying the suspect sooner than expected.                                         DNA phenotyping is one of the latest and advanced technologies of fo-                                           rensic science. This is basically a technique to predict an organism’s or                                         a person’s phenotype that is nothing but the individual’s                                           characteristic features and physical appearance with the help of                                         genetic information, that is, DNA samples.                                                     Now, you might question how this is helpful in the forensic field.                                                    As we are aware, DNA defines eye colour, hair colour, skin, etc. The                                         genetic  instructions  for  all  these  are  written  in  DNA.  Many  violent                                         crimes in America were backlogged, and that’s when DNA                                          phenotyping played a major role by giving useful leads for furthering                                         investigation and narrowing down the suspect list.","It was Parabon NanoLabs that developed a software that could give                                         information about the DNA left in the crime scene. Parabon Snapshot is                                         a DNA phenotyping tool or more of a software that creates a face imag-                                          ing sketch of a person with the help of DNA samples helping the inves-                                         tigator to know what a suspect looks like. The snapshot system hardly                                          needs a nanogram of DNA, and after the collection runs it through the                                         snapshot algorithm, it, in turn, would produce the prediction of a per-                                         son.                                                    Again, you might wonder how a snapshot system works.                                                    Everything lies in the hands of the SNP information that is “Single                                         Nucleotide Polymorphism”. In short, we can call it snips.                                                    What are snips exactly?                                                    The human genome contains approximately 3 million base pairs and a                                         variation in the single base pair is called snips. Sometimes when a                                         genome is copied to make new cells, a single base pair is left out or                                          added or even substituted. This leads to snips and this makes the                                         genetic variation. This is why we all look different.                                                    Isn’t this interesting! Just imagine how a miniature substance makes                                         a whole lot of difference.                                                    The snapshot interprets the SNP information from a DNA sample of                                          an individual to identify what a suspect looks like, and this will be                                         easier for the investigator to find the suspect.                                         It has been said snapshots are totally error-free and highly accurate, al-                                         though some of the scientists questioned the accuracy and doubted if                                         the system could recreate the face image sketch. More importantly, the                                         study and analysis of an unknown person through this snapshot sys-                                          tem requires a comparison, and if it is not possible, then the only way                                         is to search and find the DNA database of the suspected person.                                         The system is more likely dependent on a pair of reference samples.                                         It must be kept in mind that the snapshot is way too expensive, and                                          therefore it cannot be used for every investigation.                                         There are many other technologies coming up, and this latest                                         development would definitely be a great benefit.","TECHNIQUE FOR                              DEVELOPMENT                              OF HIGH-                              RESOLUTION                               FINGERPRINT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Ms. Blessy John Kalla                              IMAGES FROM                              CURVED                              SURFACES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Credits: University of Nottingham                                                                       A fingerprint is one of the important pieces of evidence found in the                                                   crime scene as it helps to identify the suspect and link the suspect to                                                   the crime scene.

James Sharp, an associate professor in the school of physics and                                   astronomy, and his team developed a technique based on spectrometry                                   known as the time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry along with                                    a significant creation of a rotation stage, which actually helps us to study                                   the fingerprint deposited on curved objects bullet, metal casings, and oth-                                   er surfaces.                                             The ToF-SIMS (Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry) is a                                    technique in which high energy beams of positive ions are made incident                                   on the sample surface to free secondary ions from the surface as they col-                                   lide with any material. The ions are then accelerated on the ToF analyzer.                                   They are distinguished based on the mass-to-charge ratio; it produces a                                   spectrum that provides a very detailed image of the chemical composi-                                    tion on surfaces of the sample.                                             How does this help obtain the high-resolution images on curved                                   surfaces like bullets or metal casing of a firearm?                                              Basically, when a bullet is fired, the metal casing experiences and                                   undergoes changes due to the environment as it is subjected to factors                                   such as high temperature, pressure, and friction. The propellant and the                                   powder residue generates a reaction process that ejects the bullet out of                                   the chamber.                                    These combined factors often result in removal, degradation, or                                   evaporation of the volatile compounds of fingermark residue like water,                                   lipid, amino acid, and obscuring, or smudging of the mark. The scientists                                   of the University of Nottingham state that these factors may complicate                                   the conventional retrieval of fingerprint marks such as cyanoacrylate                                    fuming and fluorescent staining.                                             The experts in the University of Nottingham conducted research for a                                   period of over 7 months and were able to obtain high-resolution images                                   of the fingerprint images, ridge characteristics, and the sweat pore                                    details, which  was not the case in the conventional method such as                                   cyanoacrylate fuming and basic yellow 40 dye. The rotation stage is a sig-                                   nificant feature that helps study the fingerprint marks in detail.","The main aspect that we should look into is that the conventional                                  techniques did not provide reliable and accurate detailed images. With                                  the imaging obtained with the conventional technique, it was seen that                                   there was a degradation of the quality of the image in a period of 8 days,                                  whereas it would not be visible or recognizable after 3 days and gave no                                  result after a period of 14 days. In the case of ToF SIMS, one of the                                  advantages is that in the ion beam, they were able to detect, visualize,                                  and examine the sample up to 26 days after collection.                                             According to Sharp, the experts proved that ToF SIMS provides detailed                                  high-resolution images with accurate details on different surfaces.                                  The addition of the rotation stage is significant as it helped in studying                                  the fingermarks on the surface in detail with less difficulty and                                   covering the whole surface of the sample from which the image is to be                                  obtained. It is even non-destructive, so it keeps the evidence intact while                                  it is being examined. The high-resolution images provide accurate re-                                  sults, which help in identifying the suspect or linking the suspect to the                                  crime scene or firearm ammunition.                                             Sharp is continuing to work on this technique of obtaining images from                                  the curved surfaces on the rotation stage.                                  This technique, along with the rotation stage, may be a very productive                                  contribution to the field of forensic science as it makes it easier for the                                   experts to examine the fingerprint impression to study the                                  characteristics, ridge details and obtain a high-resolution image which                                  helps to narrow down and link the suspect to the crime scene.                                  Obtaining fingerprint impressions on curved surfaces was an aspect of                                  difficulty when conventional methods of imaging were used.

The field of Forensic Journalism is the application of science - its prin-                                   ciples and techniques to journalism for the purpose of justice. Jour-                                  nalism is the field of collecting, reviewing and presenting news to the                                  masses. When science can be applied during the collection, reviewing                                   and presenting news, it can be termed as Forensic Journalism.                                   In simpler terms, a lay journalist would be able to collect, analyze and                                  publish news while a forensic journalist would be able to answer the                                  5W1H - what, when, why, where, who and how of the news.                                             What are the duties of a forensic journalist?","A forensic journalist must                                              • Look beyond the information, into the meaning, reason and relevance                                                 of news.                                              • Must work in accordance with the rules of journalism and the limits                                                 of science.                                              • Must be able to dig deep into a topic, put it in the law’s perspective,                                                 form an opinion, ensure the opinion is in line with science and pres-                                                  ent it in an understandable fashion.                                                        What are the finer rules of Forensic Journalism?                                                        The Reporters Sans Frontiers (RSF), a NGO dedicated to safeguarding                                             rights of journalists lists out ten golden rules of forensic journalism                                              as follows:                                                        1.  Any issue or topic must not be routine journalism. Instead it has to                                                 be dug deeply.                                              2.  The issue or topic that a forensic journalist is interested in must be                                                 a matter of public interest preferably of crime.                                              3. The work of a forensic journalist is time consuming. So patience is                                                 essential.                                              4. The work of a forensic journalist must be original and self-explan-                                                 atory.                                              5. The final output must possess new information.                                             6. The presentation must be able to highlight the significance of the                                                  findings.                                             7.  The output must not be based on one source alone and must be                                                  multi-sourced.                                             8. The work gets better results when multi-sourced and must incor-                                                  porate team-work than a one person effort.                                             9. The report must not have a tone of bias and must not be made with                                                  a prejudice of accusing someone.                                             10.  The work must be objective and truthful.                                                        How is Forensic Journalism different from Investigative Journalism?                                                        Investigative Journalism is a form of journalism which unveils a crime                                              like political corruption which may be deliberately concealed. But an","investigative journalist uses different means like sting operations, wit-                                              ness testimonies etc. to expose it to the public.                                                        Forensic Journalism on the other hand uses scientific understanding                                             to explain a crime in a fashion that the general public understands, or                                              sometimes even the judiciary to form an opinion. Forensic Journalism                                             is always an essential part of Investigative Journalism.                                                        Some myths regarding Forensic Journalism busted-                                                        Forensic Journalism focuses only on ‘bad news’.                                                        While Forensic Journalism often helps in exposing bad news, it need                                              not always be the case. It sometimes exposes positive news like re-                                             moving a stereotype, portraying the positive effects of an approved                                              medicine etc.                                                        Forensic journalists give anonymous reports.                                                        A genuine Forensic Journalism report would always be identified with                                             the author and would only be a tool to explain facts on the basis of                                              science, rather than being a personal document which highlights the                                             author.                                                        Forensic Journalism is an unregulated system and can be unethical                                              at times.                                                        While in some countries the statement may be true, in many nations                                             the field is regulated and bound by an ethical code of conduct where                                              the responsibility is fixed under legislation.                                                        The field is driven by private media houses and therefore not a seri-                                             ous field.                                                        Even though presently it is driven by the private media houses in many                                              countries, it is government owned in many countries where it has led                                             groundbreaking investigations.

Different techniques are employed for the development of latent                                          fingerprints found in the SoC, physical methods: dusting powder -                                          black, magnetic, fluorescent powders, and chemical methods - iodine,                                          cyanoacrylate fuming, silver nitrate.                                           Currently, a new method employed for fingerprint analysis uses                                          nanoparticles whose sizes range between 1 to 100 nanometers as it                                          produces high-quality images with clear ridge characteristics,                                          increased contrast against the background, and visibility. They have                                           properties like low size, large surface area, and optical properties that                                          favor the interaction of fingerprint residues with porous and non-                                          porous surfaces. The major advantage is it helps in the detection of                                          both fresh and aged fingerprints.","IMAGE: Nanoparticles adhering to the fingerprint residue                                                                   SOURCE: https://d2cbg94ubxgsnp.cloudfront.net/Pictures/480xA-                                                                                    ny/2/8/7/124287_fingerprint-350-for-tridion_tcm18-200397.jpg                                                Further discussing the significance of different nanoparticles in                                      fingerprint analysis:                                                 1. SILVER NANOPARTICLES                                      Silver nanoparticles have been employed since the 1970s in the UK for                                      the detection of fingerprints. The theory behind development using the                                      Ag-PD method was found in 1983.                                      • It works on the principle that colloidal silver has an affinity towards                                           the organic components present in the fingerprint residue.                                      • The Ag-PD technique is known to be the best for the development of                                          latent prints in wet conditions and on porous surfaces.                                      Iron salt is used to reduce silver nitrate to colloidal silver that reacts with                                       the organic part of the fingerprint residue to produce a black-                                      silvery image which aids in effective visualization.                                                2.

QUANTUM DOTS (QDs)                                      • These are semiconductor nanocrystals used for fingerprint                                      development.                                      • Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) QDs are fluorescent. When combined with                                           non-toxic silica nanoparticles, they give enhanced images with good                                          ridge details and less background staining on non-porous surfaces.","• Highly fluorescent, water-soluble CdTe QDs were processed with Mer-                                        captosuccinic acid (MSA) at a pH of 10. The LP can be processed by im-                                        mersing the non-porous and porous surface in the QD solution for 1-3                                        seconds.                                     • Fingerprints were developed on an aluminum foil surface by a                                    dusting powder made by combining Cadmium Sulfide, which is a                                    highly photoluminescent QD, along with Chitosan mixture and                                    Sodium Sulfide.                                              CONCLUSION                                     Fingerprints are the unique evidence found in an SoC due to their                                    ability to individualize and link the perpetrator to the SoC or the                                    victim. The development methods used play a crucial role in                                    obtaining accurate results during fingerprint analysis. The                                     conventional methods used for development may not be efficient                                    enough to obtain prints in wet conditions, aged prints, or detect                                    hidden prints. Development using nanoparticles was proven to be                                    more effective by overcoming certain drawbacks faced previously.                                    Different nanoparticles like gold, silver, zinc oxide, silica, QDs were very                                    effective in development on both porous and non-porous                                     surfaces. They produced fingerprint images of enhanced contrast and                                    less background staining, and their adhering property helped in better                                    visualization. Therefore, development using nanoparticles has                                    proven to be a great asset in the field of forensic science, thereby                                     having a great applicative potential in the future.

It’s been so strange that this case remains unsolved.","•  Gabby and Brian began their journey on July 4th, 2021.                                     •  On August 12, an unknown man called 911 to Moab, Utah Police, and re-                                         ported about the dispute between the influencer and her fiancé which                                          he had witnessed. Later police reached the spot and interrogated them;                                         all that footage was recorded by a body camera.                                     •  Gabby was crying; she was uncomfortable as well and she explained                                         her struggles with mental health.                                      •  Brian was also questioned about those visible scratches over his face                                         and arm for which he told that those were made by Gabby with her                                         phone.                                     •  From the interrogation, police simply concluded that it was not a case                                         of domestic violence, it was just because of mental and emotional stress.                                     •  Police insisted Brian stay in a hotel that night and Gabby went back to                                          their van.                                                                                                                                                               •  Till 25th August she posted pictures and videos about the trip but later                                          no more posts.                                     •  On September 1st Brian returned to North Port, FL in their van with-                                         out her and later he went for a hike in a wildlife reserve in Florida.                                     •  Ten days later Gabby’s parents reported her missing                                     •  On September 15th Brian’s attorney stated that neither Brian’s family                                         nor he would speak on any matters regarding this case.                                      •  But on September 17th police went to Brian’s house to question his par-                                         ents, but it was of no use because they were worried about their son’s                                         missing.                                     •  Later on September 19th after a long search over Bridgerton National                                         Forest in Wyoming police found human remains. The report shows that                                        the person died 3 -4 weeks before.","According to Teton County Coroner’s Officer – Dr. Brent Blue, the                                        manner of death is homicide (1st-degree murder) and the cause of death                                         is strangulation. Laundrie’s remains were found on a Florida nature pre-                                        serve one month after Petito’s body was found. His reports show a clear-                                        cut suicide (he shot himself).                                                  CONCLUSION                                         This case would not have happened as such if the police would not have                                        made those unintentional mistakes during the interrogations. As well                                        as even if Brian’s family had informed the police about any clues that                                        they knew about Gabby’s missing. If such had happened it could be a                                        turning point for the case.

The fancy idea of serial killers as acquired through society was                                           counteracted when it was found that Dennis had no childhood                                            trauma. He was a parishioner, the congregational president of his                                           church, and he also had a full-time job that made him nothing less                                           than a normal citizen of the society.                                                     Where did it all begin?                                                      The brutal series of events commenced with the killing of the Otero                                           family where Dennis murdered all 4 members of the family. This                                           brutal murderer showed no mercy to children and women.                                           Dennis strangled both Joe and his wife Julie (the Oteros) and then the                                            9-year-old, Joey. He killed him by putting a plastic bag over his head                                           and suffocating him. He took Josephine, the 11-year-old girl, to the base-                                           ment and hung her.                                           Or in Dennis’ words:                                             “I put a plastic bag over his head, then ropes and pulled him tight. First                                           of all, Mr. Otero was strangled; a bag was put over his head and                                           strangled. And then I thought he was going down. Then I went to stran-                                           gle the lady, and I thought she was. Then I strangled Josephine, I thought                                           she was down, and I went to Junior and put the bag on his head.                                           After that, Mrs. Otero woke up again and you know, she was pretty                                            upset, what’s going on? So, I went back, and at that moment I                                           strangled her to a suffocating death.”","Credits: Image provided by the                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Credits: Photo by Jeff Tuttle-Pool/                                   Sedgwick County Sheriff’s office                                                                                                                                                                                                               Getty Images                                          The Otero family-                                                                                                                                                                       Credits: Image from bizarrepedia.com                                                Dennis’s subsequent murders included:                                                • 5.

Alongside the letter was a box                                 containing a graphic description of The Otero murder.                                                                                       Use of forensic techniques                                          DNA analysis:                                 Dennis Rader’s daughter offered up a DNA swab when she suspected her                                father had something to do with it. The DNA was a close match to the                                semen found at the crime scenes. A forensic serologist was brought in to                                collect the DNA for processing and comparison.                                           Handwriting analysis:                                The police brought in a handwriting specialist to study the letters BTK                                sent in and matched them to the original one. This helped distinguish the                                suspect who was suspected of the BTK murder but wasn’t.                                           Technology:                                The police had to use the forensic technology specialist to hack into the                                diskette that Rader sent to the police. When they hacked it, they found the                                name “Dennis” and a few church documents. This was the pivotal proof                                that helped in locking up BTK.                                           Utilization of digital forensics:                                Through the use of the EnCase software, in unveiling the details regarding                                the recent activities involved in the floppy disk, there has been a whole lot                                 of room to sue Dennis. The EnCase software, in this case, turned out to be                                a very important tool. The software is designed for forensics, cyber secu-                                rity, and e-recovery. The section of e-recovery is accustomed to                                recovering deleted electronic evidence that may be used to document                                concrete evidence of crimes; electronic evidence in most cases is free from                                doubt. This explains why Dennis could finally have confessed to                                 committing crimes.                                          Therefore, computer forensics plays a major role in tracking down                                evidence, especially those that have some digital concepts or links. It is                                 possible to trace all crimes through the use of forensic techniques.                                          Sentencing:                                In February 2005, Dennis was convicted. He confessed all his monstrous","work and murders. He was charged with 10 murders and sentenced to                                 life in prison for all ten.

She was born                                  on December 24, 2004, to Rayne Perrywinkle (mother) and Billy Jarreau                                   (father), who were never married.                                  On 21st June 2013, it was not a normal day for Cherish Perrywinkle. She                                  was so happy because the next day she needed to fly to California to spend                                  her summer with her father. Cherish was living with her mother Rayne,                                  Rayne’s boyfriend and Cherish’s two younger sisters in Florida.                                  On  21st June, Rayne made Cherish ready for the trip by packing things,                                   like dresses. She wanted to buy some new clothes for Cherish, so she                                  decided to go to the shop. She didn’t have a car, so she decided to walk to                                  the Dollar General Store on Edgewood Avenue with her three daughters.","She only had $100, with which she needed to buy household items, some                                   clothes and travel to the airport. Furthermore, she didn’t have any more                                    money to buy new clothes for Cherish’s trip. At this time, Cherish took a                                   little white dress with red hearts on it. She realized that she couldn’t                                   afford it, so she put back the selected dress.                                                                                                                               A man was watching every move of Rayne and her daughters. The man                                   was waiting outside the store and struck up a conversation with Rayne                                    when she came out. He said that he was waiting for his wife and claimed                                   that they had a gift card for Walmart and that it would be helpful for                                   Rayne to buy new clothes for her children. The man who was named                                   Don introduced himself to Rayne. After some time, he said, “You can meet                                   my wife at Walmart.” At that time, it started to rain, so Rayne thought                                   about whether she could walk in the rain or take a lift from Don to get to                                    Walmart and buy some clothes using the gift card.                                             Rayne was a little hesitant, but later she agreed to the lift. Rayne and her                                   three daughters got into a white van, and they arrived at Walmart. Rayne                                    went into Walmart with her three children, and she started shopping for                                   the clothes for Cherish, meanwhile Don, the old man was waiting                                   outside. Later, he joined her, and he added a bundle of rope to the cart. He                                   had a different intention for Cherish. Don told Rayne that he would get                                   some cheeseburgers from McDonald’s. While going, Cherish also went                                   with him. Rayne thought that McDonald’s was inside Walmart, so she                                    was fine with that. After 20 minutes, Rayne began to worry and Walmart                                   announced that they were going to close the store soon. There was no                                   sign of Don, his wife, or Cherish. She searched the whole store and car                                   parking. At 11:20 PM, she called 911, as she didn’t know much about Don.                                    She described to the police whatever she knew about him. Then the                                    police came to know he was a familiar criminal. Don, a.k.a Donald Smith,                                  was 61 years old and a sex offender with offences from the 70s. He had                                   been released from jail three weeks before. The police didn’t search for","him that night. At 9 A.M, 911 got a call. A suspicious van was standing near                                   the bushes, and the police were searching for him. He drove past in the                                    van, and he was arrested. The van was empty, and Cherish wasn’t in the                                   van. Police came to know that he was wearing the same clothes - jeans                                   and a black t-shirt, and his lower body was wet.                                   Police went to the woods, and they looked for water with the help of a                                    police dog where Cherish’s body was found in the water.

This was the result of a killer on the                                            loose, who claimed to be the ‘Zodiac Killer’. He was found to be                                            operating his murderous schemes on young people and couples in the                                            secluded areas of California and Nevada. He manipulated and                                            threatened the media, mainly the local newspapers like San Francisco                                            Chronicle, the Vallejo Times-Herald and the San Francisco Examiner.                                             The letters he sent included Cryptogams - ciphers in which he claimed                                            that he was killing people to make them his slaves in the afterlife. He                                            used the San Francisco Chronicle as his literary outlet. His first letter                                            to the chronicle was attached with a cipher. In the letter, the                                             anonymous killer taunted the police by giving them gory details about                                            the murders he had recently committed. It included facts of his                                            murder that were obscured from the public eye. Most of its readers be-                                            lieved that the man wanted attention from the media or had a thirst                                            for fame.

The weapon was a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. There wasn’t a                                       single witness. Mike somehow survived the shots and briefed the","police regarding the physical features of the perpetrator. The killer                                  informed the police about his role in the crime committed in December                                  and July.

Sriki, a habitual criminal, claims to have                                       hacked online gaming websites, foreign company portals and the state                                       government’s e-procurement portal.                                        On November 4, 2020, Bengaluru’s Central Crime Branch (CCB) police                                       arrested hacker Srikrishna under the Narcotic Drugs and                                       Psychotropic Substances Act for allegedly obtaining drugs using                                       bitcoins via the darknet and peddling it to high-profile clients.

Before going further, we should now understand some terms like                                       Cryptocurrency and how Crypto Mining and exchange take place.","Cryptocurrency: Cryptocurrency is a virtual asset used as a medium of                                   exchange through a network of computers. The currencies are                                   decentralized structures that use blockchain technology and                                    distributed ledgers across numerous computers, also called non-official                                   cryptocurrencies. They are no longer patronized by any government                                   authority and in most cases are without any tangible, physical assets.                                             How is cryptocurrency earned?                                              Crypto-mining: Bitcoin mining is the technique of creating new bitcoin                                   by solving computational puzzles. The mining process also confirms                                   transactions on the cryptocurrency’s network and makes them                                   trustworthy.                                    Crypto buying and exchange: Basically, crypto exchanges permit the                                   conversion of one crypto to another and the buying and selling of                                   cryptocurrencies. These platforms set the price of digital assets (both                                   coins and tokens), based on trading activities. Cryptocurrency can be                                    brought from trading platforms like Bitfinex and coinbase. And exchange                                   can be taken by offering to accept cryptocurrency in exchange for                                   service.                                   Attack Methodology: In his voluntary declaration to the CCB police,                                   Sriki said he had hacked the Bitfinex exchange twice. “Bitfinex became                                   his first largest Bitcoin exchange hack.” And the second instance was a                                    simple spear-phishing attack that led to two Israeli hackers operating for                                   the army and getting access to the computers of one of the employees,                                   which gave them access to the AWS cloud account. He exploited a bug in                                   the data centre which gave them KVM (Kernel-based virtual machine)                                    access to the server. They rebooted the server into GRUB (GNU Grand                                   Unified Bootloader) mode, reset the password, logged in, reset the                                   withdrawal server passwords and routed the money via bitcoin to his bit-                                   coin address. And he had made a profit of around 20,008 BTC (bitcoin).                                   In August 2019, authorities at the e-procurement cell filed charges with                                   the State Police Cyber Crime Branch, professing that an unknown                                    person took Rs 11.5 crore and the officials were able to prevent the theft                                   of another Rs 7.37 crore.                                   Sriki also admitted he had hacked into the Karnataka government’s                                   e-procurement portal in 2019. The accused alleged that he acquired                                    access to the procurement site in June 2019 by exploiting “a remote code                                   execution vulnerability’’, that gave him access to tender bid details such                                   as transaction details, bid reference, payment amount, IFSCs (Indian","Financial System Code) and bidders account numbers.                                   Cyber forensic role in Bitcoin Scam Investigation: Four laptops have been                                   recovered from hacker Srikrishna Ramesh. The analysis of hard disks                                    from a laptop has discovered data of a hack carried out at an                                   e-procurement cell of the state government where Rs 11.5 was stolen by                                   a hacker gang.                                   According to the Cyber forensics report, one hard disk “fragment 01”                                    recovered from a MacBook belonging to Sriki contains hacking data for                                   alleged hacking of the e-proc.gov.in of the e-governance cell of the State                                   Government.                                   The Cyber forensics team analyzed data held in a cloud server by the                                   hacker and found that Sriki had as much as 76.13 lakh public addresses                                   for Bitcoins and as many as 26 e-wallets. Sources said these could have                                    been acquired by hacking or through data trading on the dark web as                                   part of hacker groups to steal cryptocurrency.                                             Challenges facing the crypto-landscape in India                                    Indeed as the government is drafting a bill on cryptocurrency, around                                   five million people are formally using it. But you cannot regulate people                                   holding the cryptocurrency, as the system works on blockchain                                   technology which provides privacy to its users. The government can                                   regulate the trading exchanges or platforms.                                   In India, Bitcoins are not a legal tender and are not accepted for payment.                                    There are however websites where you can redeem the cryptocurrencies                                   for vouchers from Amazon, Flipkart or other leading brands. It is only an                                   investment that the people are holding.                                   The government’s move to introduce GST (Goods and Services Tax) for                                    crypto trading through the bill would impact the investor and not help                                   curb hacking, experts say.                                   India is coming up with a new vulnerability disclosure policy. If you are a                                   security researcher or a hacker, you can report the vulnerabilities to the                                   Computer Emergency Response Team.

It is because of the presence of insects in the crime                                                 scene, especially the insects present near the corpse. Insects have the                                                 ability to reveal information about a corpse’s time of death.

It is be-                                                 cause insects colonize the corpse in a predictable sequence, also known                                                 as insect succession. The very first to arrive on the corpse are necroph-                                                 agous because of the strong scent of decomposition.

Soon after the death, approx. 30 minutes after, other insects,                                                 including house flies, dermestid beetles, and other predatory and par-                                                 asitic insects, arrive to feed on the mag gots and beetle larvae.

In the lab, the scientists try to identify each insect to their species                                                    and determine their exact developmental stage.                                                               If it is not possible, they raise some of the maggots to adulthood to                                                    confirm their species. Blowflies and flesh flies are the most useful                                                    insect species for determining the Post-Mortem Interval (PMI) or                                                    time of death.                                                               Through lab studies, scientists have determined the developmental                                                    rates of necrophagous species based on the constant temperature in                                                    the lab environment. These databases provide entomologists with                                                    a measurement called Accumulated Degree Day (ADD). ADD rep-                                                    resents physiological time.                                                               Using the known ADD, it is easy to calculate the age of the specimen                                                    from the corpse. Working backwards through physiological time, a                                                    forensic entomologist can provide investigators with a specific time                                                    period when the body was first colonized by these insects.                                                    Since these insects find the corpse within a minute or half an hour,                                                    they reveal the almost exact time of death or PMI.

But, when it comes to                                               people with special needs like pregnant and lactating women, the dis-                                               abled and people who need medical support, they are given some sort                                               of special care and considerations according to their physical, social,                                               and mental wellbeing.                                                          Let’s talk about the special needs given to a woman during her ges-                                               tation period (pregnancy period) and about the post gestation period                                               (parturition). According to the NATIONAL EXPERT COMMITTEE ON                                               WOMEN PRISONERS 1987, pregnant women need to be given special                                               care and special consideration. These women cannot be given death                                               penalty until their delivery. Most of their needs are minimally met by                                               the prison systems, and thus most of the time the mother remains at                                               high risk due to the unavailability of nursing and other needs.","The law prohibits using handcuffs on pregnant women unless they                                                   possess any sort of harm to themselves or others. Therefore to en-                                                     sure the mother’s and child’s safety, the provisions of the NATION-                                                   AL MODEL PRISON MANUAL must be followed strictly to make                                                     arrangements for the temporary release for delivery of the child in a                                                   hospital. Information on the state of women should be made to the                                                     court that has ordered detention, to enable the court to grant bail.                                                   The birth certificate of the child will not have the prison’s name as                                                     the place of birth rather will have any hospital’s name to avoid any                                                   future social stigma. The pregnant woman should be given special                                                     diet plans, separate accommodation to maintain hygiene so as to pro-                                                   tect her infant from any sort of contagion for at least a year after the                                                     child is born. She should also be arranged with treatments for a safe                                                   delivery and pregnancy, which is free of cost. The mothers should                                                     be given adequate information to make a suitable choice (medical                                                   terminations). Aadhaar cards must be provided to both mother and                                                     the child.                                                               After parturition (delivery), the child should be kept in the prison                                                   along with the mother in a manner in which they don’t feel like a                                                     prisoner. NGOs, schools, paediatricians can be engaged to ensure                                                   the basic facilities of those children to practise a healthy lifestyle.                                                     Ideally, no child should be kept in a prison along with the mother                                                   after the child is six years old.

Overnight visits must be allowed at least once a quar-                                                     ter for minor children living outside the prison to maintain a bond                                                   with their mother.

It aids the growth,                                              development, and reproduction of organisms. Besides identical twins, all                                             individuals possess unique sequences of DNA. The significance of DNA                                               evidence arises from this individualistic nature. In a forensic setting, the                                             conventional sources of DNA include blood, semen, saliva, urine, bone,                                               and hair.                                                         What is the concept of touch DNA?                                              The concept of  “touch DNA” began gaining acceptance in 1997, when Ro-                                              land A. H. Van Oorschot and Jones discovered that DNA profiles could                                              be generated from touched surfaces. Touch DNA, also called trace DNA                                              or contact DNA, is the DNA obtained from shed skin (epidermal) cells                                              transferred onto a surface during physical contact like touching. The                                              amount of touch DNA on a surface of contact can vary between a few                                              nanograms.","What is the forensic significance of touch DNA?                                                   As per the exchange principle proposed by the French criminologist                                                   Edmund Locard, whenever two objects come in contact, there occurs                                                   a transfer of material between them. This principle highlights the                                                   significance of touch DNA as trace evidence. Touch DNA is highly ef-                                                   fective in generating DNA profiles when biological fluids like blood,                                                   semen, saliva are unavailable for DNA extraction. Therefore, it finds                                                   importance in sexual assault, murder, homicide, burglary, and ques-                                                   tioned documents cases.

What factors affect the amount of touch DNA transferred?                                                   • Shedder status - Shedder refers to the individual handling an ob-                                                       ject, causing transfer of touch DNA. Individuals who left behind                                                       adequate amounts of touch DNA capable of generating complete                                                       DNA profiles immediately after washing hands are termed “good                                                       shedders” (tend to shed skin cells at a greater rate than others). The                                                       distinction between “good” and “bad” shedders remains debatable                                                       as the shedding of skin cells can depend on certain environmental                                                       factors or age, leading to a different shedding status each day.                                                   • Perspiration - Sweat can contain epithelial cells from the sweat                                                       glands, contributing to more touch DNA on a surface of contact.                                                       It may also carry away certain cells from the skin surface, increas-                                                       ing the amount of transfer DNA. Additionally, when individuals                                                       touch their face, eyes, nose, or hair, there occurs a transfer of DNA                                                       from that area which Wickenheiser (2002) termed as “loading” of                                                       fingers with DNA.                                                   • Type of contact - Studies conducted by Goray and others (2010) led                                                       to findings that increased pressure applied on the surface along                                                       with the friction that comes into play increased the amount of                                                       transferred DNA.","• Substrate - Rough and porous surfaces like wood, concrete, and                                                         grooved surfaces increase the friction between the skin and sur-                                                         face, leading to greater amounts of touch DNA than smooth,                                                         non-porous surfaces.                                                     • Time of contact - Existing research on handling time and the                                                         amount of DNA transferred during contact did not view signif-                                                         icant variations among different handler times and the amount                                                         of touch DNA extracted from surfaces.                                                               How can touch DNA be collected?                                                     The most commonly equipped technique to retrieve touch DNA                                                     from surfaces is collection using sterile cotton swabs (wet/dry). How-                                                     ever, this method has been found to cause significant sample loss                                                     (~20 –76%) during extraction. Other methods include cutting out the                                                     area for soft surfaces like garments. The most effective technique is                                                     found to be tape lifting since it could extract DNA without signifi-                                                     cant sample loss.                                                                What are the possible limitations to using touch DNA as evidence?                                                     • Though touch DNA can be recovered from surfaces like doorknobs,                                                         multiple people come into physical contact with such surfaces lead-                                                         ing to a mixture of DNA profiles. This would increase the workload                                                         in the laboratory.                                                     • Contamination by the personnel handling evidentiary items can-                                                         not be overlooked when dealing with touch DNA.                                                     • It has been found that DNA profiling from touch DNA samples on                                                         improvised explosive devices (IEDs) post-detonation has poor suc-                                                         cess rates.                                                     • Evidence like fingerprints complicate the process of fingerprint                                                         development as some development techniques hamper DNA re-                                                         covery.                                                     • Individuals need not always transfer DNA upon touching surfac-                                                         es. Furthermore, touch DNA is capable of secondary transfer. For                                                         instance, if a person uses a towel and the same is later used to wipe                                                         a gun, there occurs an indirect transfer of touch DNA to the gun.                                                         Thus, touch DNA can get transferred to a surface without direct                                                         physical contact with the surface.","Regardless of these limitations, touch DNA is still an emerging con-                                                     cept in the forensic field. Presently, several studies and researches                                                     are conducted, all aiming to examine the various aspects of touch                                                     DNA and its probative value in the justice system. Such analysis                                                     widens the scope of using touch DNA evidence for individualiza-                                                     tion in criminal cases.

Out of many things that intrigued us                                            about him was the way he could see things in people that the others did                                            not- knowing the facts about the people even before they spoke. This                                            talent or we can say technique is called non-verbal communication. In                                            this article, I would like to bring forth a few things about the same.                                                       Many times we confuse deception and non-verbal. Just because a per-                                            son is nervous, choking and scratching his neck while giving a testi-                                            mony doesn’t make him a culprit. Crimes have evolved, criminals have                                            evolved, so they needn’t always fail at the lie detector tests. But the un-                                            conscious actions can’t be controlled. If a person wears two perfumes                                            at the same time, it is clearly understood that he sweats a lot. Folding                                            hands while talking means the person has taken a defensive stature.                                            Raising an eyebrow when talking shows doubt in the listener. The ba-                                            sic tears would be either happiness or sadness.

The                                        Reserve Bank gets its role from the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. The                                         Government, on the advice of the Reserve Bank, decides the various                                        denominations of banknotes that should be used. The Reserve Bank                                        also coordinates with the Government in designing banknotes and their                                        security features. The security features include - watermark, security                                        thread, latent image of denomination numeral, numeral in colour                                        shifting  ink,  number  panels,  see-through  register,  electro-type,  bleed                                         lines, etc. These features continue to remain but their relative positions                                        may have been changed in the new design notes.                                                  Before going further, we should now understand the term                                         demonetization :                                        Demonetization is the process of removing a currency of its status as                                        legal tender. It occurs whenever there a is change in national                                        currency. The current form of money is taken off circulation and is","being replaced with new ones. Demonetization is often used as a tool                                        in modernizing a cash-dependent developing economy and to eradicate                                        corruption and crime (counterfeiting and tax evasion). In 2016, the                                        Indian government decided to demonetize the 500 and 1000 rupee notes,                                        the two biggest denominations in its currency system; these notes were                                         almost 86% of the country’s circulating cash.                                        The government’s goal (and rationale for the abrupt announcement)                                        is to combat India’s underground economy on several fronts: eradicate                                        counterfeit currency, fight tax evasion (only 1% of the population pays                                         taxes), eliminate black money gained through money laundering, and                                        terrorist financing activities, and to promote a cashless economy.                                                                                                                                    Comparison study of security in 500 rupee denomination :                                        The various security features are:                                        1.  Security Thread-                                        The security thread is a plain, non-readable fully embedded continuous                                        line. All the currency notes possess a security thread. When notes are                                         held against the light, the security thread present on Rs.2000, Rs.500                                        and Rs.100 can be seen.
